This project is a very simple project which just contains a puthon script to automate the process of moving downloaded files to different folders according to the file type. 
Eg. If you have demo.jpg image downloaded in the Downloads folder this script will auomatically move that to Downloads/images folder and in the same way it moves other file type to there respective folders like .docx/.pdf/.txt files to Downloads/documents folder and so on.

- Shutil is again a python module which offers number of high level operations on files and collection of files. It provides us functions which supports copying, moving and removal of files.
